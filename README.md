# üåê A time zone helper

tz helps you schedule things across time zones. It is an interactive TUI
program that displays time across a few time zones of your choosing.

# Installing

The quickest thing is probably to grab a release, but no one will be
harmed if you build from source.

# Usage

Start tz to show the local time, as well as the UTC time zone. It's
nicer to set the `TZ_LIST` environment variable with a comma-separated
list of [tz data][tzdata] zone names:
